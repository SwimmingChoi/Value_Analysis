        I will describe a person who have values between 1 and 6 for each value.
        1 means the value is not important to him at all and 6 means the value is very much important to him.

        Value Definition:
        - Achievement: values personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards
        - Benevolence: values preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent
        personal contact (the ‘in-group’)
        - Conformity: values restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and
        violate social expectations or norms
        - Hedonism: values pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself
        - Power: values social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources
        - Security: values safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self
        - Self-direction: values independent thought and action–choosing, creating, exploring.
        - Stimulation: values excitement, novelty, and challenge in life
        - Tradition: values respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that one’s culture or
        religion provides
        - Universalism: values understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all
        people and for nature

        
        Value Score:
        - Achievement: {self.achievement_score}
        - Benevolence: {self.benevolence_score}
        - Conformity: {self.conformity_score}
        - Hedonism: {self.hedonism_score}
        - Power: {self.power_score}
        - Security: {self.security_score}
